# PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS
The Objective of this Project is to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address gender-related issues within the organization and its regions using different visualizations.

# Description of the Project (Project Overview) 
- **Project Title:** PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS
- __Prepared By:__ ODUNOWO, ADEBISI TIMOTHY [E-mail](oducrown@gmail.com)
- **Company Represented:** FORT AT FORT IT LTD.

### N.B:
Working on this project has helped me to showcase my ability to analyse critically, think critically for perfect solution to both simple and complex challenges, especially while analysing data for useful insights and solution. Adopting the various existing tools in Power BI Desktop for analysing, presenting insights in a visualised way has made this project a possibility.

# PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS Report
- Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender and for this obvious reason, a generic gender status of "undisclosed" was assigned to them.
- For some that are no longer with the company, they were taken out of the database.
- Some departments are indicated as “NULL”, such were taken out as well.

the company’s 
HR data 

The dataset adopted was PALMORA-GROUP-HR data. [Download Here] ([Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21091630/Palmoria.Group.Bonus.Rules.xlsx)

)

# Tools Used
Power BI Desktop was the major Software used in completing this project. The Power BI Desktop was used for:
- Extracting the Company's HR CSV files
- Loading the dataset to the canvass for exploration
- Data Transformation i.e. Data Cleansing
- Data Modeling and Visualization

# Analysis Tasks
Using the TRanformation tools in Power BI Desktop, answers were provided for the following Questions below: 
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management 
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
   - How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.? 
- Also visualize this by regions.

- From the other dataset handed over that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to: 
  - Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
 - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
 - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

Using the cleaned dataset and pivot outputs, an interactive visual dashboard was built which summarises the results of each pivoting process on the dataset for this project. A snapshot of the Dashboard is shown below:

# Key Insights from Dashboard Analysis
1. Rating vs Discount
   
**Observation**
The "Rating vs Discount" radar chart reveals no clear linear trend between discount percentage and product ratings. Some products with discounts above 0.6 (60%) still maintain strong ratings, indicating:
- Discounts do not significantly lower customer satisfaction.
- Customers are generally satisfied even when prices are heavily slashed.
  
**Implication**
Retailers can confidently run deep discount campaigns without fear of damaging product reputation, especially for quality products.

2. Average Price vs Discounted Price by Category
   
**Observation**
Across categories like Consumer Electronics, Home & Kitchen, and Office Supplies, there are noticeable gaps between actual prices and discounted values. Some categories show consistently high discount sums.

**Implication**
- Certain product categories (e.g., Electronics) are highly competitive, leading to consistent discounting.
- Price sensitivity is evident; discounts may be necessary to remain relevant.
  
3. Highest Average Rated Products
   
**Observation**
The chart indicates that certain categories like Consumer Goods and Electronics dominate the list of products with the highest average ratings.

**Implication:**
- These categories have the potential for brand loyalty and positive customer perception.
- Sellers should prioritize these high-performing SKUs in marketing efforts.
  
4. Additional Metrics and Findings

5. **Business Recommendations**
   
1.	Leverage High Ratings + Discounts:
- Prioritize marketing of highly rated, deeply discounted items to maximize conversions.
  
2.	Category Targeting:
- Focus discounting on price-sensitive categories while maintaining margins in premium segments.
  
3.	Enhance Rating Visibility:
- Use badges, highlight reels, or featured sections to showcase top-rated products in listings.
  
4.	Data-Driven Promotions:
- Launch dynamic pricing models using insights from average rating and review count to fine-tune discount levels.
  
**Summary**
This analysis supports a data-informed approach to optimizing product listings, discounts, and customer satisfaction. The findings show that aggressive discounting can be effective, customer satisfaction remains strong, and category-level dynamics should drive marketing and pricing decisions.
