# PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS
The Objective of this Project is to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address gender-related issues within the organization and its regions using different visualizations.

# Description of the Project (Project Overview) 
- **Project Title:** PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS
- __Prepared By:__ ODUNOWO, ADEBISI TIMOTHY [E-mail](oducrown@gmail.com)
- **Company Represented:** FORT AT FORT IT LTD.

### N.B:
Working on this project has helped me to showcase my ability to analyse critically, think critically for perfect solution to both simple and complex challenges, especially while analysing data for useful insights and solution. Adopting the various existing tools in Power BI Desktop for analysing, presenting insights in a visualised way has made this project a possibility.

# PALMORA-GROUP-HR-ANALYSIS Report
- Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees refused to disclose their gender and for this obvious reason, a generic gender status of "undisclosed" was assigned to them.
- For some that are no longer with the company, they were taken out of the database.
- Some departments are indicated as “NULL”, such were taken out as well.

The dataset adopted was PALMORA-GROUP-HR data. [Download Here] ([Palmoria Group Bonus Rules.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21091630/Palmoria.Group.Bonus.Rules.xlsx)

)

# Tools Used
Power BI Desktop was the major Software used in completing this project. The Power BI Desktop was used for:
- Extracting the Company's HR CSV files
- Loading the dataset to the canvass for exploration
- Data Transformation i.e. Data Cleansing
- Data Modeling and Visualization

# Analysis Tasks
Using the TRanformation tools in Power BI Desktop, answers were provided for the following Questions below: 
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management 
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement? 
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: 
   - How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.? 
- Also visualize this by regions.

- From the other dataset handed over that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to: 
  - Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees 
 - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
 - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

# Results
**N.B: The results for each questions stated above are contained in the PALMORA ZIP Folder attached to this project.**

Using the cleaned dataset and visualization tools, an interactive dashboard was built which summarises the results of each pivoting process on the dataset for this project. A snapshot of the Dashboard is shown below:

# Key Insights from Dashboard Analysis
**Palmoria Group HR Analytics Report:** 
__Tackling Gender Inequality and Pay Compliance__
__Brief Insights and Interpretations__

**1. Gender Distribution**

The gender distribution at Palmoria is relatively balanced, with 465 male employees (49.15%) and 411 female employees (46.62%). However, department-level analysis reveals gender concentration in certain departments, such as Training and Support, which appear male-dominated, while others like R&D and Sales show better balance.
This indicates a need to improve gender diversity within specific functional areas.

**2. Performance Ratings and Gender**

Analysis of performance ratings by gender shows that male employees receive more “Very Good” and “Good” ratings compared to females. In contrast, female employees are more likely to be rated as “Average” or remain “Not Rated.” This disparity raises concerns about potential performance evaluation bias or unequal recognition, warranting a review of the appraisal system.

**3. Gender Pay Gap**

While the overall salary difference between genders is modest (₦76.68K for males vs. ₦74.16K for females), departmental breakdowns highlight deeper disparities:
- In Sales, males earn ₦175K on average, while females earn ₦150K — a significant ₦25K gap.
- In Support and Services, male employees also earn more than their female counterparts.

These patterns suggest the presence of a gender pay gap, particularly in revenue-driving departments, requiring urgent attention.

**4. Salary Regulation Compliance**

The average salary across the company is ₦75.8K, which falls below the newly mandated minimum of ₦90,000 for manufacturing companies. This implies that a large portion of Palmoria’s workforce is currently underpaid, in violation of the regulatory requirement. Salary adjustments will be necessary to meet legal compliance and avoid potential sanctions.

**5. Regional Representation**

Current data heavily reflects the Lagos region, with unclear or missing employee data from other regions (e.g., Abuja, Kaduna). This may limit the effectiveness of regional comparisons. Further investigation is needed to validate and include regional diversity in the analysis.

**Conclusion**

Palmoria Group has taken a positive step by initiating this HR analysis. The findings highlight critical issues around gender pay equity, performance fairness, and salary compliance. Addressing these areas will not only improve internal fairness but also strengthen the company’s public image and readiness for expansion.
